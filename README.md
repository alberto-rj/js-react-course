# 🚀 React Projects

This repository contains projects I built while learning **React.js** through [**John Smilga's course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/?referralCode=FEE6A921AF07E2563CEF). Each project focuses on essential React concepts, making it useful for beginners who want to practice or developers looking to explore specific implementations.
